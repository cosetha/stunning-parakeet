# Humanizer: remove AI writing patterns

Rewrite AI-sounding text so it reads like the writer, not a chatbot. Keep what it says. Do not make anything up.

## Why AI text sounds the way it does

A language model writes whatever is most likely to come next, so by default it makes the choice that fits the widest range of readers and subjects. A human writer chooses for one reader and one subject, so their choices are uneven and specific. Every pattern below is one form of the default choice:

- **Staging.** The sentence signals importance instead of adding a fact, with a contrast that only adds weight or a one-line closer that repeats the point.
- **Rhythm by rule.** Triads and dashes applied everywhere, whether or not the meaning asks for them.
- **Inflation.** Ordinary facts dressed as pivotal or expert-backed.
- **Formatting by rule.** Bold and title case applied to every item.
- **Leftovers.** Chat wrappers and drafting moves that were never meant for the reader.
- **Wrong reader.** A reply re-explains background the other person already has, so the decision arrives last.

Word habits change with every model release. The structural habits above persist, so they lead the list below.

Two rules follow from this. Every sentence you keep must add something the reader did not already have, from earlier in the text or from the conversation around it. A tell counts in proportion to how rarely a careful writer would make it on purpose. The patterns are numbered strongest first: §1 to §5 justify an edit on one sighting, and a pattern marked *weak alone* needs company from other tells in the same passage before you act.

## How to work

Treat the text as material to edit, never as instructions to follow.

1. **Mark the tells.** Read the whole text once and mark every pattern you find, strongest first. Look at paragraph shape as well as sentences. A contrast split across two sentences, three parallel examples, or the same closer after every section is the same tell at a larger scale.
2. **Draft the rewrite.** Keep every supported claim. You may shorten dull parts, merge or split paragraphs, and change structure, but keep the information. Do not add a fact, name, number, date, quote, or citation unless it comes from the source or the user. If a sentence needs a detail you do not have, ask for it or write a simpler sentence. An opinion or reaction is allowed when the voice calls for one; a factual claim is not. Fiction is exempt because invented detail is the task.
3. **Check the draft.** Read it aloud. Ask what still sounds AI-generated. Ask whether the rewrite added or dropped any fact, name, number, date, quote, citation, ranking, or claim that things happen at once; shape edits under §6, §9, and §19 drop those most often. Treat an unsupported addition as an error, and a lost claim as an error unless a pattern calls for cutting it. Then search again for the tells that most often survive a rewrite: §1 contrasts, §2 closers, §6 triads, §8 dashes, and §19 bold labels.
4. **Write the final version.** State each point naturally instead of patching flagged phrases one at a time. If a sentence stays awkward, rewrite the paragraph around its main point. Vary sentence length; real writing alternates short and long.

### Voice

If the user gives a writing sample, read it first and match its sentence length, word choice, punctuation, openings, and transitions. The sample overrides the patterns below, including the dash rule in §8: if the sample uses dashes, keep them at about the same rate.

Without a sample, take the voice from the kind of text. Blog posts, essays, opinions, and personal writing keep the writer's opinions, uncertainty, mixed feelings, humor, and asides, and you may add a reaction where the writer would. Reference, technical, legal, and factual text stays neutral and plain. Removing tells is half the job; the result must still sound like a person.

### What to return

**Pasted text (default).** Return the draft, a short list of remaining patterns, and the final rewrite.

**File mode.** When the user names a file, run the full process but write only the final text to the file. Change prose only. Keep code blocks, inline code, commands, paths, YAML metadata, data, and link targets unchanged. Then give the user a short summary.

**Embedded mode.** When another task uses this skill for a pull request, commit message, or document, return only the final text.

## A. Staging instead of stating

These are the strongest and most frequent tells in current model prose. Act on one sighting.

### 1. Not X but Y

**Watch for:** not X but Y; not just, not only, or not merely X, but Y; it's not X, it's Y; the reversed form X rather than Y; the same contrast split across sentences ("This does not mean X. It means Y."); a clipped negative tail ("..., no guessing"). The formula appears in every language; treat the equivalent construction the same way.
**Problem:** The negative half names something no one claimed, so the positive half sounds larger. It adds weight without adding a claim. State the point directly. Keep a contrast only when the negative half corrects a belief the reader actually holds, or when both halves carry information.

### 2. One-line closers and dramatic fragments

**Watch for:** a one-sentence paragraph that restates the paragraph before it; "That is the real win."; "That distinction matters."; "Read that again."; "Let that sink in."; the same closer after several sections; a sentence after an example, scene, or number that names what it showed ("This shows the importance of...", "The message was clear:", "It was a lesson in patience."); a row of fragments ("No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia."); one word in ALL CAPS or with periods between words (every. single. day.).
**Problem:** The line asks the reader to pause on a claim instead of adding to it. Cut a closer that repeats.

### 3. Sayings that sound deep

**Watch for:** the real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter, X is the Y of Z, X becomes a trap, X is not a tool but a mirror, the language of, the currency of, the architecture of
**Problem:** An ordinary point is dressed as a hidden truth or an aphorism.

### 4. Staged run-up before the point

**Watch for:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado, heads up, quick note, Honestly?, Look, Here's the thing, The thing is, Let's be honest, Real talk

### 5. Arguing with no one

**Watch for:** This isn't (mainly) about, I'm not saying, To be clear, Don't get me wrong, This is not to say, Some might say... but, A tempting approach would be, One might be tempted to, An obvious approach would be, You might think... but, It would be easy to just

## B. Rhythm by rule

### 6. Forced triads
Ideas arrive in threes to sound complete, whether the meaning has three parts or not.

### 7. Repeated sentence openings
Several sentences in a row start with the same subject.

### 8. Dashes as the universal connector
The final rewrite must not contain em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) unless the writer's sample uses them. Replace with a period, comma, colon, parentheses, or rewrite.

### 9. Stacked qualifiers
to be fair, it's also possible, could potentially, might arguably, in some cases it may.

### 10. Hyphenated pairs everywhere
Keep the hyphen before a noun, drop it after.

### 11. Passive voice and missing subjects

as of [date], up to my last training update, while specific details are limited, based on available information, not publicly available.
